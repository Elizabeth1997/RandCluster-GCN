 RandCluster-GCN: Simple, Efﬁcient and Powerful

In this project, we doubt the conclusion drawn based on insufﬁcient experimental results and analysis in Cluster-GCN work that random clustering performs worse than METIS clustering. By doing extensive experiments and analysis, We argue that random clustering this simplest and most efﬁcient clustering method is powerful enough as long as it is used in a correct and proper way (e.g., partitioning graph into a small number of clusters).
